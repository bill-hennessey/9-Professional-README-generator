## Description

This is command line application that generates a quality README.md file automatically based on user inputs (like the ones I'm typing in right now). I used the Inquirer npm library to code in the questions that populate the sections of the Readme and create the file with a file system method (also required in).

## Installation

Simply type into the terminal 'node index.js' to invoke the program.

## Usage

After running the program, answer the questions and marvel as the file is created automatically in the same directory.
